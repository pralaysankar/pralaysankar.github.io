            <h1>Mount Roraima, Venezuela</h1>
            <p>Mount Roraima (Spanish: Monte Roraima; Tepuy Roraima Portuguese: Monte Roraima [ˈmõtʃi ʁoˈɾajmɐ], and Cerro Roraima;) is the highest of the Pakaraima chain of tepuis (table-top mountain) or plateaux in South America. First described to Europeans by the English explorer Sir Walter Raleigh during his 1595 expedition, its 31-square-kilometre (12-square-mile) summit area is bounded on all sides by cliffs rising 400 metres (1,300 ft). The mountain also serves as the tripoint of Venezuela, Guayana Esequiba and Brazil.</p>
            <p>Mount Roraima lies on the Guiana Shield in the southeastern corner of Venezuela's 30,000-square-kilometre (12,000-square-mile) Canaima National Park forming the highest peak of Guayana's Highland Range.</p>
            <p>The highest point in Guayana Esequiba and the highest point of the Brazilian state of Roraima lie on the plateau, but Venezuela and Brazil have higher mountains elsewhere. The triple border point is at 5°12′08″N 60°44′07″W, but the mountain's highest point is Laberintos del Norte.</p>
            <p>85% of this tepui is in Venezuelan territory (Bolívar state), with 10% in the territory of Guayana Esequiba (Cuyuni-Mazaruni, Zone also claimed by Venezuela), and 5% belonging to the state of Roraima in Brazil.</p>
            <p>Many of the species found on Roraima are unique to the tepui plateaus with two local endemic plants found on Roraima summit. Plants such as pitcher plants (Heliamphora), Campanula (a bellflower), and the rare Rapatea heather are commonly found on the escarpment and summit. It rains almost every day of the year. Almost the entire surface of the summit is bare sandstone, with only a few bushes (Bonnetia roraimae) and algae present. Low scanty and bristling vegetation is also found in the small, sandy marshes that intersperse the rocky summit. Most of the nutrients that are present in the soil are washed away by torrents that cascade over the edge, forming some of the highest waterfalls in the world.</p>
            <p>Although the steep sides of the plateau make it difficult to access, it was the first recorded major tepui to be climbed: Sir Everard im Thurn walked up a forested ramp on 18 December 1884 to scale the plateau, the route also used by the Clementis in their climb of 15 January 1916. It is currently one of the most important mountain trekking routes in Venezuela, visited by people from many places in the world.</p>
