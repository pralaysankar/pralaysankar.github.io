            <h1>Benagil Cave in Algarve, Portugal</h1>
            <p>The Algarve (UK: /ælˈɡɑːrv, ˈælɡ-/, US: /ɑːlˈɡɑːrvə, ælˈ-/, Portuguese: [alˈɡaɾvɨ], Arabic: الغرب‎, romanized: al-gharb (Algarbe), lit. 'the west') is the southernmost region of continental Portugal. It has an area of 4,997 km2 (1,929 sq mi) with 451,006 permanent inhabitants, and incorporates 16 municipalities (concelho or município in Portuguese).</p>
            <p>The region has its administrative centre in the city of Faro, where both the region's international airport (IATA: FAO) and public university, the University of Algarve, are located. The region coincides with Faro District. Tourism and related activities are extensive and make up the bulk of the Algarve's summer economy. Production of food, which includes fish and other seafood, different types of fruit and veggies such as oranges, figs, plums, carob pods, almonds, tomatoes, cauliflowers, strawberries and raspberries, are also economically important in the region.</p>
            <p>Although Lisbon surpasses the Algarve in terms of tourism revenue, the Algarve is still, overall, considered to be the biggest and most important Portuguese tourist region, having received an estimated total of 7.1 million tourists in 2017. Its population triples in the peak holiday season due to seasonal residents. Due to the high standards of quality of life, mainly regarding safety and access to public health services, as well as due to cultural factors and considerably good weather conditions, the Algarve is becoming increasingly sought after, mostly by central and northern Europeans, as a permanent place to settle.[16] A 2016 American-based study concluded that the Algarve was the world's best place to retire.</p>
            <p>Benagil is a small Portuguese village on the Atlantic coast in the municipality of Lagoa, Algarve, in Portugal. Up to the late 20th century, the village's economy was based on ocean fishing. Now it is a tourist area with a widely used beach: Praia de Benagil. This village and beach are located close to the world famous Marinha Beach. Benagil caves are the most popular of all the maritime caves in Portugal.</p>
