                <p>On Travel with Anda I share my travel experience and tips, so you can get new ideas about your next vacation, travel destination or just a short weekend escape. I have travelled to over 60 countries so I think it is safe to say that everyone will find something interesting to read here. </p>
                <p>Nope, I am not just another travel blogger who quit her job to become a “world traveler”. Trust me, unless you are someone with over 1 million followers on Instagram, you cannot live normally from traveling and posting photos. Sure, you can earn some decent pocket money, but if you really want to make a living out of it, it is hard work. And I mean hard work, way over 8 hours a day.</p>
                <p>Quitting my job was never an option. Mostly because I am one of those lucky bastards who can honestly say “I love my job”. I work as a Sales Director in the company Edyoda where we produce top quality web design scholars. I strongly believe that healthy lifestyle is the key to enjoy everything else, so I will write about it occasionally in my blog. Besides keeping me fit and healthy, my job also enables me to travel on business quite a lot.</p>
                <p>Besides traveling and spending time with my two sweethearts (one of them is much taller and a bit less hairy), I am obsessed with all kinds of sports. I used to play volleyball on a semi-pro level, but lately I prefer individual sports, like running, indoor workout and hiking. I am also a movie freak (I used to work with a movie magazine which was the coolest job ever, but unfortunately a bit underpaid), and I can predict Oscar winners with 95% certainty (according to my own calculator, but you should know statistics has never been my cup of tea).</p>
